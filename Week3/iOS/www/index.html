          charitable foundations chosen by the StreetLinks team. At 2011's 3rd Annual
          Backyard Bash, we raised $10,500 and donated 3,281 pounds of canned and

          national retail and wholesale platforms. Steve also led one of the nation's
          largest captive appraisal management companies. Steve joined StreetLinks
          because, "as a former customer ordering thousands of appraisals per month,
          StreetLinks was the only company who consistently met the demands of everyone
          in the lending cycle - from LO to Processor to Underwriter to Investor;
          given the current lending and regulatory environment, and having been a
          customer of almost every major traditional appraisal management company
          in my career, StreetLinks is positioned as the 'best of breed' to meet
          the appraisal needs of this market."

          are contagious, and have helped to propel both StreetLinks and the mortgage
          industry forward for over 10 years. Tom’s transition from SVP to EVP to
          President at StreetLinks has allowed him to expand his focus and become
          an even more integral part of StreetLinks’ growth, product development
          and commitment to pushing the status quo.

          upon graduation from Indiana University. As a licensed appraiser and astute
          business developer, Chad was instrumental in the rapid expansion of Superior's
          client base while simultaneously building Superior's largest team of in-house
          appraisers. As the company diversified into a national appraisal management
          company, Chad helped to pioneer the best-of-breed processing and operations
          platform that differentiates StreetLinks from it's competition today. With
          a strong focus on business culture, exceptional customer service, and technological
          systems, Chad continues to execute the ongoing management needs of StreetLinks'
          unique appraisal quality and delivery platform.

          A Look Back at StreetLinks Lender Solutions
          <sup>
            ®
          </sup>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our roots date back to 1995 when current StreetLinks Chief Strategy Officer,
          Tony Ebeyer, founded Superior Appraisal Services, which grew to be the
          largest and most technologically advanced appraisal firm in the Midwest.
          Four former Superior appraisers still hold key management positions at
          StreetLinks today.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2008, Superior's innovation and focus on quality, timely appraisals
          was recognized as industry-leading in light of the new HVCC regulations.
          The company was acquired in part by NovaStar Financial, bringing with it
          key management staff, including current CEO, Steve Haslam. The company
          was renamed StreetLinks National Appraisal Services and quickly became
          one of the fastest growing, most reputable appraisal management companies
          (AMCs) in the industry.
